# LLM_Part1
Experimenting with LLMs for different use cases

There are codes to do the following:
1. Use an instruction based prompt to generate data of diverse toxic, profane and hate responses - leveraging Mistral (on your laptop)
2. Do the same using Mistral from HuggingFace gallery.
3. Fine tune a BERT model using data generated through the above process.
